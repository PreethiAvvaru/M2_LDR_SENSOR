# Abstract
Light-dependent resistances (LDR) are cheap light sensors. A less known light absorber, but only detects pulsed light. The aim of this study was to analyze the use of a pulsed light. A photoacoustic spectroscopy se tup was used, substituting the photoacoustic chamber by the light sensor proposed.
